Former special operator turned data scientist. I'm currently a Master's student in Data Science at [Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu/). My academic interests include machine learning, statistical inference, and data visualization.

I studied Mechanical Engineering as an undergrad at [Wisconsin](https://www.wisc.edu/). Briefly got tired of engineering and changed my major to Mathematics, before switching back and doing both. Afterwards, I joined the Army and became a [green beret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces). I served as a medic and spent time in both 5th and 19th Special Forces groups, as well as various places around the Middle East.

Lately I find myself very interested in data and machine learning. I am also drawn to the computer science / software development side of my studies and am doing a fair amount of self-study in that vein. Some examples of my work can be found on the [projects](/projects/) page.
